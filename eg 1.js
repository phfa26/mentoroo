function myFunction() {
  alert("Hello World!");
}
myFunction();

//Almost there, but you are criating an Alert, and the exercise asked for a console prompt.
//Also, theres no need to put it in a function, a single line with alert("Hello World!"); would do the same job. Just nit-picking, btw.
