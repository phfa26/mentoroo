# Mentoroo exercises


 - **Clone this repo**
 - For each exercise from exercises.js create a folder with the exercise number: eg 1 or exercise-1*
	- *Doesn't matter which pattern you use, as long as you stick to it.
- In each exercise folder create a index.js file and copy the exercise task as a multi line comment at the top of the file.
- After the exercise is done, create a review.js file and leave it empty, these way I know which tasks you have completed and I will add the exercise's feedback there.# mentoroo
